# New support for building Dakota with CMake 
# This works by making Dakota appear as a subdirectory of TriKota
# and is enabled by configuring with TriKota_ENABLE_DakotaCMake on.
# This gives you complete control of the Dakota configure through your
# Trilinos configure scripts, makes it much easier to rebuild Dakota
# after updates, and is much faster.
#
# Currently Dakota does its own checking for libraries such as blas,
# lapack, boost, mpi, etc... which ultimately we would want to pass in.
# Also the following packages likely need to be disabled via 
# -D HAVE_X=OFF, where X is:
#   ACRO, HOPSPACK, AMPL
# Acro isn't cmake'd yet anyway, but boost_signals will be a problem.
# HOPSPACK doesn't link correctly in static builds.
# Turning AMPL on caused very strange runtime errors.
# I don't know how to turn these off by default.
